## Shift Covered
- **Time:** 9:00 PM – 5:00 AM
- **Actual work time:** ~8 hours
  (Includes development, testing, fixes, and deployment prep)

---

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Inventory Stock Status Display on Products
- **What I did:** Added real-time stock status badges (In Stock / Low Stock / Out of Stock) to product cards on the products page
- **What problem this solves:** Partners can now see product availability at a glance before placing orders, preventing orders for out-of-stock items
- **Who benefits:** Sales / Partners / Admin

### 2. Products Page Inventory Integration
- **What I did:** Connected the products page to the inventory API, fetching both products and inventory data in parallel for efficient loading
- **What problem this solves:** Stock levels are now dynamically calculated based on actual inventory data rather than static displays
- **Who benefits:** Sales / Partners

### 3. Inventory Page API Integration
- **What I did:** Replaced mock data with actual API calls using the inventory service, implemented proper TypeScript types for inventory data
- **What problem this solves:** The inventory management page now displays real data from the backend instead of placeholder content
- **Who benefits:** Admin / Packing

### 4. Code Cleanup and Type Improvements
- **What I did:** Removed inline type definitions in favor of centralized types, cleaned up imports, and improved code organization
- **What problem this solves:** Better maintainability and consistency across the codebase
- **Who benefits:** Development team

## Technical Work (Supporting Details)

**Components/modules improved:**
- `frontend/src/app/(portal)/products/page.tsx` - Added inventory integration with parallel API fetching
- `frontend/src/app/(portal)/inventory/page.tsx` - Refactored to use proper API client and types
- `frontend/src/components/products/ProductCard.tsx` - Added StockStatus type export and stock badge rendering

**New functionality:**
- `getStockStatus()` function to calculate stock status based on inventory levels vs reorder points
- `getStockBadge()` helper for rendering color-coded stock badges

**Types used:**
- Leveraged existing `Inventory` type from `@/types/inventory`
- Exported new `StockStatus` type for reuse

---

## Business Impact Summary
- Partners can now see real-time stock availability before ordering
- Reduces failed orders due to out-of-stock products

---

## Current Status
- **Overall progress:** On track
- **Blockers:** None

---

## Next Planned Tasks
- Finalize and commit current inventory display changes
- Add inventory filtering and search functionality
- Implement low stock alerts/notifications

---

## Notes
- Current changes are uncommitted and ready for review
- Stock status logic uses reorder_point as the threshold for "Low Stock" indicator

## Executive Summary

Today's work focused on enhancing the customer ordering experience and ensuring our email notification system delivers complete information to both partners and staff. We successfully planned new cart features and identified a technical gap affecting email completeness that will be addressed in the next session.

## Today's Accomplishments

### ✅ 1. Cart & Order Flow Design — Complete

We designed an improved ordering experience for partners:

| Feature | Description | Benefit |
|---------|-------------|---------|

### ✅ 2. Email System Quality Check — Complete (Issue Found)

- **What needs fixing:** Customer details (name, email, company) appear blank in emails
- **Impact:** Staff currently need to manually look up customer info — minor inconvenience
- **Solution:** Identified and documented for next session fix

### ✅ 3. Investigation & Documentation — Complete

Created comprehensive documentation so the issue can be quickly resolved:

## Summary for Stakeholders

**Today's Progress:** We continued building on yesterday's email notification system while planning the next major feature — a shopping cart for partners. During quality testing, we found that order confirmation emails weren't including customer details, which we investigated and documented for a quick fix.

**Bottom Line:** Development is proceeding on schedule. The issue found is minor and has a clear fix. Partners can currently place orders and receive confirmations — the only gap is that internal staff emails need a manual lookup for customer details, which will be resolved in the next session.

**Tomorrow's Focus:** Fix the email issue and begin implementing the shopping cart feature, which will allow partners to order multiple products in a single transaction.

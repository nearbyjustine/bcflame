## Shift Covered
- **Time:** 9:00 PM – 5:00 AM (x2 days)
- **Actual work time:** ~16 hours total
  (Includes development, testing, fixes, and deployment prep)

---

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Admin Login Routing Fix
- **What I did:** Fixed the login system so admin users now go directly to their Admin Portal instead of the regular dashboard
- **What problem this solves:** Admins were landing on the wrong page after logging in, causing confusion and extra clicks
- **Who benefits:** Admin staff

### 2. Products Management System
- **What I did:** Built a complete product management section in the Admin Portal where admins can view, create, edit, and delete products. Added inventory tracking and image upload features
- **Why it matters to operations:** Admins can now manage the entire product catalog without needing technical help or backend access
- **Current status:** Done

### 3. Users Management System
- **What I did:** Created a user management section where admins can view all resellers, see their order history, and block/unblock accounts when needed
- **Why it matters to operations:** Gives admins full visibility and control over reseller accounts, making it easier to handle customer support issues
- **Current status:** Done

### 4. Real-time Notifications
- **What I did:** Added a notification bell in the Admin Portal that shows alerts every 30 seconds, with unread badges and the ability to mark notifications as read
- **What problem this solves:** Admins can now stay informed about important events (new orders, issues) without manually refreshing or checking multiple places
- **Who benefits:** Admin staff

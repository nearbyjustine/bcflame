# Daily Progress Report: BC Flame Premium Client Portal

**Date:** January 7, 2026
**To:** Management Team
**From:** Development Team

---

## 🚀 Executive Summary
Today marks the successful **foundation and kickoff** of the BC Flame Premium Client Portal. We have established the technical groundwork (server, database, and security) and built the "front door" of our digital VIP Lounge.

The system is now live in our development environment, secure, and ready for the next phase of feature building.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished Today

### 1. The "Foundation" is Poured (System Setup)
Just like building a physical lounge, we needed a solid foundation before adding furniture.
*   **Completed:** We successfully set up the entire "Brain" (Backend) and "Face" (Frontend) of the application.
*   **Result:** The application allows the website, the database, and the admin tools to talk to each other seamlessly using a containerized environment (Docker). This ensures the app runs smoothly and reliably.

### 2. The "Front Door" is Installed (Security & Login)
We have built the security checkpoint that ensures only approved partners can enter.
*   **Completed:** A secure Login Screen is now functional.
*   **Result:** 
    *   Authorized users can log in with their credentials.
    *   Unauthorized visitors are automatically blocked and redirected to the login page if they try to access internal pages.
    *   The system securely remembers valid sessions so users don't have to log in repeatedly during a session.

### 3. The "Manager's Office" is Open (Admin Panel)
We set up the control center where BC Flame staff will manage the app.
*   **Completed:** The Content Management System (Strapi) is installed and connected to our database.
*   **Result:** Staff now have a dedicated area (Admin Panel) where they will soon be able to upload product photos and update inventory counts without writing a single line of code.

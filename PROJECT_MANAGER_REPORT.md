## Notes for Project Manager

The portal is progressing well with all Phase 2 core features completed. The product catalog and customization system are fully functional and tested. Partners will have a professional, efficient tool for browsing products and placing customized orders.

The modular architecture we've built allows for easy addition of new features in Phase 3. All code follows best practices and includes documentation for future developers.

**Recommended Next Review:** After Phase 3 features (Media Hub and Analytics) are implemented.

# BC Flame Premium Client Portal – Stakeholder Overview

**Date:** January 6, 2026  
**Audience:** Management, Finance, CEO  
**Purpose:** To define the scope, purpose, and business value of the Premium Client Portal in clear, non-technical terms.

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The **BC Flame Premium Client Portal** is a secure, invitation-only digital workspace designed exclusively for our approved partners and resellers. Unlike our public landing page, which serves as a general advertisement, this portal acts as a **"VIP Lounge"** where our partners conduct business, view real-time inventory, and access specialized product information.

## 2. Concept: What is a "Portal"?
To understand the difference between our current website and this new project, consider this analogy:

### The Public Website = "The Storefront Window"
*   **Who:** Anyone walking by (General Public).
*   **What:** They can look through the glass to see what we are about, but they cannot touch or transact.
*   **Goal:** Brand awareness and marketing.

### The Premium Portal = "The VIP Lounge / Members-Only Club"
*   **Who:** Only approved members with a specific "Key" (Username & Password).
*   **What:** They can enter a private room to see exactly what is on the shelves, check stock levels, and plan their orders.
*   **Goal:** Operational efficiency and direct business-to-business (B2B) facilitation.

### Key Characteristics
1.  **Access is Restricted (The "Key"):** 
    *   The general public cannot see anything inside.
    *   Only partners approved by BC Flame can enter using unique credentials.
2.  **Content is Specialized (The "Inside"):**
    *   It replaces manual spreadsheets and phone calls.
    *   Partners see live product availability, specific packaging options, and inventory updates that are confidential or irrelevant to the general public.
3.  **It is Interactive (The "Function"):**
    *   It is a tool, not just a brochure.
    *   **Staff** can upload photos and update stock counts instantly.
    *   **Clients** can browse live inventory to plan their sales without needing to call us.

## 3. Business Value: Why Build This?
Currently, resellers face challenges like frequent product changes, delays in knowing stock availability, and the need for manual coordination.

**The Portal Solves These Problems By:**
*   **Centralizing Information:** One "source of truth" for all product data.
*   **Real-Time Visibility:** Partners see what is available *right now*, reducing "is this in stock?" inquiries.
*   **Efficiency:** Reduces the manual workload on our sales and operations teams (less time sending photos/lists, more time closing deals).
*   **Professionalism:** Provides a polished, reliable experience for our high-value partners.

---

## 4. Project Scope: Phase 1 (Initial Launch)
Our focus is on delivering a stable, usable tool quickly.

### ✅ What IS Included:
*   **Secure Login:** A gatekeeper system for authorized partners.
*   **Product Gallery (Client View):** A clean interface for partners to view available products, photos, and descriptions.
*   **Inventory Visibility:** Clear indicators of what products are currently in stock.
*   **Admin Management (Staff View):** Tools for BC Flame staff to easily upload products, change photos, and update text without needing a developer.
*   **Packaging Display:** Showcase of available packaging and customization options.

### ❌ What is NOT Included (For Now):
*   **Online Payments:** Transactions will still be handled via invoice/existing methods.
*   **Automated Ordering System:** Clients will view stock here but place orders through standard channels initially.
*   **Consumer Sales:** This is strictly B2B.
*   **Complex Warehouse Syncing:** Inventory updates will be managed by staff initially to ensure accuracy before automation.

## 5. Roadmap & Reporting
We are following a phased development approach to ensure quality and speed.

*   **Phase 1:** Build the core "VIP Lounge" – secure, stable, and informative.
*   **Phase 2 (Future):** Add "Room Service" – ordering features, history tracking, and more interactive tools.

**Progress Updates:**
A daily progress report will be submitted to management after each development shift, detailing:
*   What was completed.
*   What is in progress.
*   Any questions or blockers requiring decision.

*This document serves as the finalized reference for stakeholders regarding the BC Flame Premium Client Portal project.*

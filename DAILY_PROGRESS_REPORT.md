# BC Flame Premium Client Portal - Progress Report
**Date:** January 10, 2026

## Executive Summary

Today we made significant progress on the BC Flame Premium Client Portal, focusing on building out the product customization features that will allow your cannabis product partners to personalize their packaging. We've laid the groundwork for a complete customization system that will give partners creative control over their product presentation.

## What We Built Today

### 1. **Product Customization System Foundation**

We created the backend infrastructure that stores and manages all customization options for cannabis products. Think of this as the foundation that will power your partners' ability to customize their packaging designs.

**Key Features Added:**
- **Product Size Selection** - Partners can now choose from different product sizes (1g, 3.5g, 7g, 14g, 28g) with automatic price adjustments
- **Bud Style Options** - Visual display settings for how cannabis buds appear on packaging
- **Background Styles** - Customizable background designs for product packaging
- **Font Styles** - Typography options for product labels and text
- **Prebagging Options** - Configuration for product packaging preferences

### 2. **Smart Data Organization**

We set up the database structure to efficiently store:
- Product customization preferences for each partner
- Pricing information tied to product sizes
- Custom text and design elements
- All the visual styling options mentioned above

### 3. **Order Inquiry System**

Built a system for tracking product inquiries that includes:
- Automatic inquiry number generation (like order tracking numbers)
- Storage for customer information and contact details
- Product specifications and customization details
- Status tracking from initial inquiry through completion

### 4. **Quality Assurance & Testing**

We implemented automated testing to ensure everything works reliably:
- Created test coverage for the product size selector
- Built tests for the image carousel feature
- Set up validation checks for data accuracy

### 5. **Demo Frontend (Your Addition)**

You created a demonstration interface outside of the main project to show stakeholders how the customization features will look and work in practice.
